In September 2017, a set of disk images for the Game Doctor
copier were shared with me, and I was asked to figure out how to
translate them to more common formats.  This led to two scripts:

- Unpacker for 41K Game Doctor disk images
- Unpacker for FDS disks in general, with or without internal CRCs
