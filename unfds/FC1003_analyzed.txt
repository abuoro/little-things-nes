I will use FC1003.A as an example.

There is a prefix for the whole file, whose meaning is unknown.
A Game Doctor extractor built as an FDS extractor can ignore it.
00 00 83

Chunk $01 at offset 0x0003 is the 56-byte file system header chunk,
beginning with a 15-byte sync pattern:
0: 01 "*NINTENDO-HVC*"

15: Mfr code: FF
16: Game fourcc: "B002"

Rest of header is zero-filled, leading to these values:
20: Revision: 00
21: Side number: 00 (A)
22: Disk number: 00 (Disk 1)
23: Has shutter: 00 (no)
24: Disk color: 00 (yellow)
25: File IDs to load at startup: 00 (none)

At offset 0x003B are two bytes representing where the CRC would be.
CRCs are omitted in the scene's FDS format but included in complete
images of a Quick Disk, such as those used by Virtual Console.
In this image, all CRCs are zero.

Chunk $02 at offset 0x003D is a 2-byte chunk denoting the number of
files visible to FDS BIOS.
0: 02
1: File count: 3

Chunk $03 at offset 0x0041 is a 16-byte directory entry describing
the following file.

0: 03
1: Consecutive file number, first being 00
2: File ID used with FDS API: 00
3: 8-byte filename in ASCII: "CARDGAME"
11: Destination address: 4FFF
13: File size: 0008
15: Region: 00 (WRAM)

Chunk $04 at offset 0x0053 is the file contents.  This may configure
the mapper.

80 E0 "B002" 00 00

Chunk $03 at offset 0x005E is another directory entry.
0: 03
1: Consecutive file number is also 00, making this invalid
2: File ID is also 00
3: Name is "CARDGAME"
11: Destination address is 4FFF
13: Size is 8000
15: Region: 00 (WRAM)

Chunk $04 at offset 0x0070 is file contents, obviously the PRG ROM.

Chunk $03 at offset 0x8073 is a directory entry.

0: 03
1: Consecutive and ID still aren't set
3: "CARDGAME" again
11: Address: 4FFF
13: Size: 2000
15: Region: 01 (CHR RAM)

Chunk $04 at offset 0x8085 is CHR contents.

The next chunk would be expected at $A087, but the image ends there.
