[unassigned pattern events]
program change
note on + delta time 1 row
tempo change

let's see... if we did rows per minute then we'd need a counter wrapping at 3600.
This is doable in 4 bytes of memory (playback speed and clock phase) and 12 bits of
order 


Order table format

0x xx : Goto order x
1x xx : Goto order x (all channels)
2x xx : Play pattern x
3x xx : Set tempo to x (all channels)
40 xx : Set channel transpose to (signed char)x
41 xx : Set instrument to x

Pattern table format

00-47 : Play note and wait 1 row
48 xx xx : Set channel tempo to x rows per minute
49-4B : unassigned
4C    : Legato OFF
4D    : Legato ON
4E xx : Set instrument to x
4F    : End pattern
50-5F : Wait n-$4F vblanks
60-6F : Hold: Wait n-$5F rows
70-7F : Rest: Cut and wait n-$6F rows
80-8F : Cut after n-$80 vblanks of the next row
90-FF : unassigned

"Instrument 0" means each note turns on a different instrument, each played at note 0.
