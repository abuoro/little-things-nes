Attempts at making a sound driver.  Each time I tried, I got
distracted, until 2009 when I made the first version of what is
now known as [Pently](https://github.com/pinobatch/pently).

- "p8mus" is from June 2001, built with x816
- "5" is from November 2003, built with ca65
- "balance" is from November 2004, built with ca65

Currently "5" and "balance" build; "p8mus" needs to be ported.
This appears to place the date at which I transitioned from x816
to ca65 sometime before November 2003.
