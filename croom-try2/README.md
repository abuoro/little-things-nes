# Concentration Room Emblem Designer

This is a sample of the second attempt to develop the NES game now
known as _Concentration Room_.  The canon codebase is [try 3], and
it has been suggested to eventually merge Emblem Designer into try 3.

In accordance with modern sensibilities, some changes have been made
to the source code of try 2 before publication in little things.

* The software has been updated to build with the same toolchain
  as the rest of little things: circa 2018-2019 versions of cc65,
  Python 3, and Pillow.  Some intermediate files remain.
* The title has been changed to "Concentration Room" or "Try 2"
  throughout.
* Insignia of a notorious German hate party have been changed
  to the number 45, the 2 least significant digits of the year
  in which the hate party was defeated.
