=== About ===

If you were in the PC game scene in the early 1990s, you've most
likely played the QBasic game Nibbles.  Now it has been ported to
the Nintendo Entertainment System and Family Computer.


=== Installation ===

To build Nibbles from sources, run mkall.bat from the DOS prompt.
You'll need the DJGPP compiler and the x816 assembler.  The build
process will produce nibbles.bin (16 KB program followed by 8 KB
graphics) and nibbles.nes (iNES format ROM image).

Nibbles is designed to run on an NROM cartridge with a 4 KB (or
larger) program ROM and a 4 KB (or larger) graphics ROM.  It should
work on most emulators; it has passed tests with LoopyNES, NESten,
nester, RockNES, and BioNES.  (NESticle is no longer supported.)
To run Nibbles on a real Famicom or NES console, you need an NROM
board modified to use EEPROM chips, and an EEPROM programming device.
Follow the instructions that came with your development kit.


=== Play ===

At the copyright screen, press Start.

At the title screen, select the number of players with the
up and down arrows on the + Control Pad, and press Start.

During the game, move your snake with the + Control Pad.  Eat apples
to grow longer and get points.  Avoid walls, other snakes, and your
own rear end to survive.


=== Changelog ===
