# x816 things

These are all untested

* `bingo` is GNOME vs KDE: Battle of the Desktops (June 2000).
  It needs work to make the sprites not invisible.
* `insane` is a very incomplete attempt to clone SameGame, inspired
  by the TI-83 port by Martin Hock and Bill Nagel.
* `nibbles` is a port of a QBasic game, the origin of the "Damian
  Yeppick" misnomer from a misreading of the font in one version, and
  the first time I felt tension between ROM organizing tools and the
  "release early and often" mentality of the free software community.
  I've even seen it pop up on NOAC famiclones' built-in pirate
  multicarts despite everything that's broken about its code from
  having been tested exclusively on emulators of the time.
