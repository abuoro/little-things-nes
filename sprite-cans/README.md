#Sprite Cans

In 1962, Andy Warhol painted 32 Campbell's soup cans, ushering in the
pop art movement.  In 2000, Damian Yerrick doubled this, drawing 64
Sprite cans.

This program displays 64 soda cans bouncing slowly off the sides
of the screen.  It uses OAM cycling to make sure that no Sprite
disappears entirely for more than a frame at a time.

Feel free to spread this ROM and its source code.
