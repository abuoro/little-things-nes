Missile Command
===============

At some point in third quarter 2017, there was speculation that
the publisher of _Missile Command_ would commission a version
for a famiclone based on the engine of _Thwaite_.  The scope of
modification was not confirmed; it was going to be either a total
conversion to resemble the official Atari 5200 port or just a
rebranding of _Thwaite_ as a prequel with a title like
_Missile Command Tales: Thwaite_.  These title screen graphics
were mocked up.
