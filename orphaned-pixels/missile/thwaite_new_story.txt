ABOUT 200 YEARS BEFORE ZARDON COLONY FOUNDING

One night, there was a loud boom in the sky above the village.
Staisy awoke and looked around, but when she could not find a
thunderstorm, she went back to bed.

Ten minutes later, another boom.  Staisy took another look and began
to smell smoke.  Fearing the worst, she tossed on a cloak and ran out
of her house to find Milo, who was on night watch duty.  A minute
later, she was face to face with Milo and out of breath.  "Milo, did
you hear that loud boom?"

"Calm down.  Nobody panic.  Which way was it coming from?"

"That way!" she panted.

Milo looked toward where Staisy was pointing and corrected himself.
"Now you can panic!" as he saw rockets headed for the village.

A few seconds of hyperventilation later, he remembered the fireworks
launchers.  "Now, Staisy, listen to me.  There are rockets flying at
us, and if we're not careful, our neighbors might get hurt.  So go
into the police station and climb the stairs to the highest floor.
You'll find a control unit for the fireworks launcher.  There's a
manual, but now isn't the time to read it.  Just keep in mind what
the fellow who installed it told me:  'Move the crosshair with the
joystick, and shoot a firework with the fire button.  And watch your
ammo!'  I'll be at the other launcher in the town hall.  Take this
key and hurry!"
