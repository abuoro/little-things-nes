This was conceived in March 2012 for implementation in 2019 or later
once certain patents owned by Konami expired.  It is now 2019.

nesdidder:
1. Get Stephania by Ilona Karmel synopsis from the net
2. Draw column of LDUR areas
3. Make a DWI parser
4. Make a step bytecode format

The story:
The goal is to work in as many rhythm game puns as possible.

Chronology:
Concentration Room (pre-war), then the second game (during the
war), then the dance game

The heroine is named Stephania (Steph for short).  This name is a
variant of Stephanie, from old Greek meaning "crowned" or "winning",
but calls to mind StepMania.  (See also "han fang ji" and
Ilona Karmel.)
Steph is from a country that has been buying out businesses, making
them citizen owned like GM briefly was in the real world USA,
as a more gradual transition to communism than, say, the USSR.
The country is the DDR, the D-- Democratic Republic.  (Pun on
East Germany; still need to figure out what D stands for.)
So Steph wants to be a dancer when she grows up.  She joins her
school's line dancing troupe.

Player 2 controls Dieter.  (Also pun.)

The game loop of didder:
1. Find the current scroll position
2. If an arrow is just passing, record its proper time
3. Compare the most recent step on each arrow to the recent arrows' proper times
4. Draw all arrows
5. Draw judgments

Pently offers bpmmath, which allows calculating the beat fraction
for step chart scrolling purposes.
