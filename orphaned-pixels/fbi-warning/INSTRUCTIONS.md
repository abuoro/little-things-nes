# Anti-Piracy Warning Seal for 2bpp platforms

This low-resolution copy of the FBI Anti-Piracy Warning Seal (the
APW Seal) is necessary to display the APW Seal legibly on a work
designed for a 2-bit-per-pixel picture generator.  This adaptation
to 2bpp is not itself endorsed by the FBI.

Before releasing a proprietary work, follow these steps:

1. Visit the FBI's website and download the APW Seal image.
2. Visually compare the APW Seal downloaded from the FBI's website
   with this low-resolution copy.  If you find any material visual
   difference between the two, do not use this low-resolution copy.
3. Display the APW Seal as depicted in `FBI_Anti-Piracy_Warning.png`,
   with the box border, preferably on a screen by itself.  It
   consists of areas with black and white, and areas with white,
   blue, red, and yellow; ensure these are distinct.
