## Conditions Regarding Use of the FBI Anti-Piracy Warning (APW) Seal

The following conditions of use are specified in 41 CFR, Section 128-1.5009(e):

- The APW Seal shall only be used on copyrighted works subject to
  protection under U.S. Criminal Code provisions such as those in
  Title 18, U.S. Code, Sections 2319, 2319A, and 2319B.
- The APW Seal shall only be used immediately adjacent to the
  authorized warning language. “Authorized warning language” refers
  to the language set forth below in paragraph (a) of this section,
  or alternative language specifically authorized in writing for this
  purpose by the Director of the FBI or his or her designee and
  posted on the FBI’s official public Internet website
  (http://www.fbi.gov). Except as authorized pursuant to paragraph
  (1) of the prohibitions regarding use of the APW Seal, the APW Seal
  and authorized warning language shall be enclosed by a plain box
  border at all times that other text or images appear on the same
  screen or page.
    > The unauthorized reproduction or distribution of a copyrighted
      work is illegal. Criminal copyright infringement, including
      infringement without monetary gain, is investigated by the FBI
      and is punishable by fines and federal imprisonment.
- The APW Seal image must be obtained from the FBI’s official public
  Internet website (http://www.fbi.gov). The APW Seal image shall not
  be animated or altered except that it may be rendered in outline,
  black and white, or grayscale.
- In programming or reproducing the APW Seal in or on a work, users
  are encouraged to employ industry-recognized copyright
  anti-circumvention or copy protection techniques to discourage
  copying of the FBI APW Seal, except that such techniques need not
  be used if no other content or advertising programmed into the same
  work on the same media utilizes such copyright anti-circumvention
  or copy protection techniques.
