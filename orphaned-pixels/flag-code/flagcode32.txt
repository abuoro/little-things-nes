flags from International Code of Signals and US Navy

file contains positions from ' ' to '_'

' '..')': Navy numerals
'0'..'9': ICoS numerals
'@': Navy shift to ICoS; ICoS understood or decimal point
'A'..'Z': ICoS letters
'[': ICoS prompt pennant
'\'..'_': ICoS substitute for 1st through 4th flag in word

Programs using this file may cut off the top and bottom
pixel of each flag in order to hoist flags onto a character
cell grid.

Programs on limited palette platforms may replace
black with blue and white with yellow.

color codes within file:
black, blue, red, yellow, white: common ICoS colors
green: rare ICoS color, used only in prompt signal
sky blue: represents shape of flag
light green: no flag encoded to this position

For the substitutes, a "word" is a sequence of letters
or a sequence of numerals. For instance, VV is V(1st),
1100 is 1(1st)0(3rd), but L 2330 is L 23(2nd)0.
In a numeral word, repeaters don't count '@' as
decimal point.
