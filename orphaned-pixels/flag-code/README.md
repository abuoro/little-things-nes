# Flag code

At various times, I had some sort of obsession with the International
Code of Signals, a set of flags that can be used to represent the
alphabet.  I imagined that shops would fly flags with the name of
the shop and what is being sold.  It might have been helpful for
nomadic people who could just put up a flagpole when setting up a
stand in a market.
