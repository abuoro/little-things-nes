Start with all 144 mahjong tiles.  The bottom layer of the turtle
layout is eight rows, which have from top to bottom 12, 18, 10, 12,
12, 10, 8, and 12 tiles.  Centered on top of this, add layers of 6x6,
4x4, and 2x2 tiles, and one tile centered on top of that.  Finally,
add one tile to the left center and two tiles to the right center of
the bottom layer.

Officially the tiles use black, red, green, and blue

so the pf is 16x8
