Bet phase
---------
If a column is open, player can key in a bet.
Pressing Enter after keying in a bet changes the bet to the minimum of the bet and player's funds, deducts the bet from the player's funds, and makes the column active.
Pressing Enter without keying in a bet puts the rest of the columns in busted state.
Make double and split inactive and unavailable on each column.
Deal one card to the dealer.

Deal phase
----------
For each unbusted column with fewer than 2 cards, deal one card.
When the second card is dealt, evaluate each column.

If upcard is A, ask for insurance now.

If 21, stand.
If 9, 10, 11, or soft, and the bet is no more than half the table limit, make double available.
If a pair, make split available.

If split is available, and the player's funds are no less than this column's bet, and at least one column is busted, show a question (Split)/(No).
If chose Split, make double unavailable, move the second card to a new column, set the bet on that column, make split active on both columns, and return to deal phase.
If chose No, make split unavailable.

If double is available, and the player's funds are no less than this column's bet, show a question (Double)/(No).
If chose Double, make double active.
If chose No, make double unavailable.

If chose Hit, or double is active,
