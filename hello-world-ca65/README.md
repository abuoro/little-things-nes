# hello world

This is a 'hello world' program for NES development using ca65,
the 6502 assembler included with cc65.  It was created on October
24 through 26, 2003, preceding nrom-template by roughly 8 years.
This, Nibbles, and sound-drivers/5 represent the clearest evidence
of when I switched from x816 to cc65.

With this project being such a milestone in build practice, I have
decided to preserve the original build system (`mk.bat`), folder
structure (or in this case lack thereof), and buggy vblank behavior
alongside the `makefile` used for exhibition in little things.
